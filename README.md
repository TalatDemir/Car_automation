It's a modern, user-friendly application with features like buying a car, posting car sales ads, renting a car, and scheduling appointments for special events. It has a simple interface. It can be further developed and integrated into sectors beyond the automotive industry.

You must register to use it, but you can try it out by logging in with the username admin and the password 1234 for a demo.

Created using Sqlite3, Python, and PyQT.

It contains three files: the SQLite3 code written to create the database for the tools, the pre-created database, and the code file containing all the functions.

A simple and useful application, have fun!
